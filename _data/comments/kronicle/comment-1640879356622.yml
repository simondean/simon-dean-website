  Collectively, these bloggers are doing just what Simon suggests: attending
  meetings, developing sources and holding government accountable every day. And
  the best of the crop are doing so individually, on their own and, somehow,
  basically for free. Simon should spend as much time as he can on A Better
  Oakland original posts down the center column , a thoroughly reported blog on
  the nitty-gritty of Oakland politics, complete with key video moments from
  government meetings, illuminating crime analysis, skillful fact-checking of
  political puffery, transit coverage, development coverage, thorough meeting
  recaps, spicy guest posts, and, yes, the occasional media criticism along with
  support for the press against government stonewalling.
