  Simon should spend as much time as he can on A Better Oakland original posts
  down the center column , a thoroughly reported blog on the nitty-gritty of
  Oakland politics, complete with key video moments from government meetings,
  illuminating crime analysis, skillful fact-checking of political puffery,
  transit coverage, development coverage, thorough meeting recaps, spicy guest
  posts, and, yes, the occasional media criticism along with support for the
  press against government stonewalling. With so much quality civic reporting
  already being done online for little or no pay, it stands to reason we could
  eventually get quality government reporting entirely from bloggers, both
  professional and amateur, rather than depending on a federally-coddled cabal
  of conspiring nonprofit newspapers, as Simon envisions.
