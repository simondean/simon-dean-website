There are so many streaming services available now (Netflix, Disney+, Prime Video, Now TV, Sky, Apple TV etc.) it can 
be really difficult to find out which service has a particular TV show or film that you're looking to watch.  
[JustWatch](https://www.justwatch.com/) is a brilliant solution to this.  You just enter the name of a TV show or film
into the search box on the JustWatch website and then their site shows you exactly which places that TV show or film 
is able to stream or buy.  For example https://www.justwatch.com/uk/tv-series/how-i-met-your-mother shows the details
for the TV show "How I Met Your Mother".  As of January 2022, it shows that "How I Met Your Mother" is available to 
stream for free with a Disney+ subscription and can be bought from 
[Prime Video](https://www.amazon.co.uk/b/ref=as_li_qf_br_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&node=3010085031&tag=simondean-21&camp=1634&creative=6738&linkCode=as2&linkId=eb5bc367fe1bf217ef4c20fa66d65b73), 
Apple TV, Google Play, Rakuten TV, Chili or Microsoft.  

JustWatch can be really useful for finding films that are free to stream (with a subscription, like Amazon Prime or 
Netflix) or working which streaming service carries a particular TV show.  E.g. 
https://www.justwatch.com/uk/tv-series/friends-1994 shows Friends is currently available on Netflix.
