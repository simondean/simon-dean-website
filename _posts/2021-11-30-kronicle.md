Kronicle is an open source project I've been working on for the last year or so.  Kronicle provides a way to visualise 
a whole tech stack and the teams that work on it. It combines `kronicle.yaml` files that you check into your code 
repos, with data automatically gathered by Kronicle from places like code files in Git repos, Gradle build scripts, 
Zipkin, SonarQube etc.

There's a live demo of Kronicle running on Kubernetes on AWS at 
[https://demo.kronicle.tech](https://demo.kronicle.tech) and a [video with more info](https://youtu.be/xNvoxBmMQdk). 
See [https://kronicle.tech](https://kronicle.tech) for the main project website.

Kronicle has a Vue.js/Nuxt.js based Single Page App (SPA) and a Spring Boot based service. It runs on Kubernetes 
and a Helm chart is provided.
