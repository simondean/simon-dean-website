When staying in a hotel, AirBNB property or holidaying anywhere else with a TV, if the TV has an available HDMI port, 
Amazon's Fire TV Stick can be a great way to watch Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+ etc. if you have subscriptions to 
those services, or you could rent or buy TV or movies.

Compared to something like a Google Chromecast, an Amazon Fire TV stick has some key advantages:

1. The Fire TV Stick is completely self-contained.  It can connect directly to a hotel WiFi network or other WiFi 
   network.  
2. The Fire TV Stick has its own remote control, meaning you don't need to mess with your mobile phone to control the 
   Fire TV Stick, which simplifies things when using it in a Hotel room or holiday accommodation.  
3. It has an app store for installing apps like Netflix and Disney+

Amazon makes a few different versions of the Fire TV Stick:

1. [Fire TV Stick Lite](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07ZZW7QCM/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=simondean-21&creative=6738&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07ZZW7QCM&linkId=630c0e85dc35f026d8e2c3be699c9f8f)
2. [Fire TV Stick](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08C1RR8JM/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=simondean-21&creative=6738&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B08C1RR8JM&linkId=ad4ee8101d97df39ec9e4a328e6b9783)
3. [Fire TV Stick 4K](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08XVVPXX4/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=simondean-21&creative=6738&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B08XVVPXX4&linkId=780a3752acd55a61eb4b1cc53ec348d2)
4. [Fire TV Stick 4K Max](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08MQZYSVC/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=simondean-21&creative=6738&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B08MQZYSVC&linkId=b6eae4776f1296d090039dfdc4689127)

The Fire TV Stick 4K Max is the version of the Fire TV Stick that I would recommend.  It has these features that make 
it stand out from the other versions:

1. 4K support (the none "Max" version also supports 4K)
2. Supports the AV1 video codec that streaming services are starting to use.  This future proofs this version of the 
   Fire TV Stick
3. WiFi 6 support

If you are travelling away from your home country, you will probably need a VPN service to access your streaming 
subscriptions like Prime Video, Netflix and Disney+ when in a foreign country.  Some VPN services like 
[Surfshark](https://surfshark.club/friend/THX2ztUY) have native apps for the Fire TV Stick which can be fairly easy to 
get set up.
